## 📋 Overview
EcoSystem Pro is a robust ERP solution tailored for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Costa Rica. The system streamlines core business processes, including inventory control, supplier management, concurrent sales processing, and system auditing.

This project serves as a capstone portfolio piece, integrating advanced concepts from my **Systems Engineering** degree, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and enterprise-grade software standards.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Backend:** .NET 10 (C#) - ASP.NET Core Web API.
* **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS (UI/UX Design).
* **Database:** SQL Server (Relational).
* **Infrastructure:** Microsoft Azure Integration & GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
* **Methodology:** Agile/Scrum with daily progress tracking.

## 🏛️ Architecture & SOLID Principles
The project follows **Clean Architecture** patterns to ensure a decoupled, testable, and maintainable codebase:
1.  **Domain:** Core business logic and entities (Applying **SRP**).
2.  **Application:** Use cases and interface definitions (Applying **DIP**).
3.  **Infrastructure:** Data persistence and external service implementations.
4.  **API:** Entry points and controllers (Applying **ISP**).

## 📅 Agile Management (Sprint Log)
As part of my commitment to **Project Development Methodologies**, I maintain a daily commit habit. Each commit documents technical progress and theoretical learning.
> Detailed Sprint history can be found in `/docs/AGILE_LOG.md`.
